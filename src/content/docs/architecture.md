Cairn Identity is a monorepo with one Rust API, one SvelteKit web app, and focused Rust crates for reusable domain logic.

## Runtime Components

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  browser["Browser"]
  operator["Operator"]
  web["apps/web\nSvelteKit adapter-node UI"]
  api["apps/api\nAxum API and operator CLI"]
  mcp["apps/mcp\nstdio release-evidence tools"]
  postgres[("Postgres")]
  oidcClient["OIDC client"]
  scimClient["SCIM client"]
  emailProvider["Command email provider"]

  browser --> web
  web --> api
  operator --> mcp
  oidcClient --> api
  scimClient --> api
  mcp --> evidence["Release evidence directory"]
  api --> postgres
  api --> emailProvider
```

```text
Browser
  -> apps/web  SvelteKit adapter-node UI
  -> apps/api  Axum API, OIDC/OAuth provider, SCIM provider, operator CLI
       -> Postgres
```

The web app is stateless. It serves login, consent, user, and admin screens, then calls the API with cookie credentials and CSRF headers.

The API owns migrations, sessions, OAuth grants, MFA ceremonies, account lifecycle tokens, signing keys, audit events, SCIM provisioning, and operational commands.

## Authorization Code Flow

```mermaid

  participant User
  participant Client as OIDC client
  participant Web as CairnID web
  participant API as CairnID API
  participant DB as Postgres

  Client->>API: GET /oauth2/authorize with PKCE
  API->>Web: Redirect to login or consent
  User->>Web: Login and approve consent
  Web->>API: Complete browser session or consent
  API->>DB: Persist authorization code
  API->>Client: Redirect with code and state
  Client->>API: POST /oauth2/token with code verifier
  API->>DB: Consume code and issue tokens
  API->>Client: ID token, access token, optional refresh token
```

## Operational Boundaries

```mermaid

  operator["Operator"]
  cli["cairn-api operator commands"]
  runtime["API runtime"]
  evidence["Release evidence directory"]
  keys["Signing keys and KEK operations"]
  audit["Audit export and purge"]
  restore["Restore checks"]

  operator --> cli
  cli --> evidence
  cli --> keys
  cli --> audit
  cli --> restore
  runtime --> keys
  runtime --> audit
```

## Crates

- `cairn-domain`: organization-scoped entities and validation types.
- `cairn-authn`: password hashing, random secrets, PKCE, TOTP, and WebAuthn helpers.
- `cairn-oidc`: OIDC/OAuth policy, discovery, claims, and signing helpers.
- `cairn-database`: SQLx repositories, migrations, row mapping, and persistence DTOs.
- `cairn-audit`: audit event builders and metadata redaction.
- `cairn-api`: Axum routing, protocol endpoints, admin/session APIs, SCIM endpoints, deployment health checks, and operator commands.
- `cairnid-mcp`: local stdio MCP server exposing read-only release-evidence plan, manifest, status, and check tools.

## API Boundaries

The API keeps HTTP parsing and response shaping near the route layer while shared protocol helpers live under focused modules:

- `http/oauth_*`: OAuth form parsing, bearer handling, token exchange, introspection, revocation, and UserInfo helpers.
- `http/oidc_*` and `http/authorization`: browser authorization, consent retry state, logout, and redirect response helpers.
- `http/scim_*`: SCIM authentication, query parsing, projection, resource rendering, PATCH, Bulk, and metadata helpers.
- `http/admin_*`: admin user, group, OIDC client, consent, audit, and pagination handlers.
- `http/mfa*` and `http/account_*`: MFA and account lifecycle routes.
- `operations_*`: preflight, release evidence, public-surface smoke checks, restore checks, and dependency-policy evidence.

## Storage

Postgres is the only application database. Migrations live in `infra/migrations` and are embedded by SQLx. Migration filenames use contiguous four-digit numeric prefixes, and tests reject duplicate, missing, or malformed versions.

Tenant isolation is enforced through organization-scoped rows and tenant-bound repository methods. Sensitive runtime tokens are stored as hashes or encrypted payloads where applicable.

## Deployment

The API and web UI ship as separate containers:

- Root `Dockerfile`: builds and runs `cairn-api`.
- `apps/web/Dockerfile`: builds and runs the SvelteKit adapter-node app.
- `infra/docker-compose.yml`: local Postgres, API, and web stack.
Both long-running services expose `/healthz`. The API health check verifies HTTP serving and Postgres reachability; the web health check verifies the adapter-node runtime.

Cairn Identity has not published a first public RC. A release can be recommended for production use only after every required gate below has current evidence from the required environment for that gate.

## RC Compatibility And Support Matrix

This matrix defines the first-RC support boundary. It is not a production-readiness claim; entries remain blocked until the required evidence below is current and the release is published.

| Area | RC support status | Supported scope/version | Tested runtime/platform | Public artifact/install path | Required evidence | Explicitly unsupported |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Release status | Pre-beta; no first public RC has been published. | First-RC compatibility target only; production recommendation waits for every required gate. | Current CI and local release-gate commands only. | None until maintainers publish a reviewed GitHub Release. | Every required gate below, plus no current blocker. | Production readiness, OpenID Certification claims, supported production releases. |
| OIDC/OAuth | First-RC target; not OpenID Certified. | Config OP and Basic OP target. Browser and OpenID conformance path is Authorization Code + PKCE with query response mode and `S256`; token endpoint also supports `authorization_code`, `refresh_token`, and configured confidential-client `client_credentials`. | `cairn-oidc` tests, API token/metadata tests, deployed metadata smoke, and external OIDF suite evidence. | API endpoint from a reviewed source/container deployment; no standalone OIDC service artifact. | `oidc-metadata-smoke.json`, static registration/config artifacts, `openid-config-op-result.json`, `openid-basic-op-result.json`. | Implicit, hybrid, resource-owner password grant, dynamic registration, `response_mode=form_post`, request objects through `request` or `request_uri`, and general claims-parameter support. |
| SCIM | Optional v1 subset; disabled unless `CAIRN_SCIM_BEARER_TOKEN_SHA256` is configured. | SCIM 2.0 User and Group subset, ServiceProviderConfig/Schemas/ResourceTypes, exact filters/SearchRequest, bounded PATCH, bounded Bulk, bearer-token hash rotation. | `cairn-api scim` tests, built-in SCIM smoke, and external Okta/Entra connector summaries. | `/scim/v2/*` on the deployed API; connector profiles from `cairn-api scim connector-profile`. | `scim-generic-connector-profile.json`, `scim-okta-connector-profile.json`, `scim-entra-connector-profile.json`, `scim-smoke.json`, `scim-okta-connector-smoke.json`, `scim-entra-connector-smoke.json`. | Sort, changePassword, ETags, cursor pagination, Shared Signals/security events, password synchronization, nested groups, broad multi-valued PATCH semantics, certified directory templates. |
| MCP | Local read-only stdio server for release-evidence inspection. | `cairnid-mcp` tools: `cairnid.evidence_plan`, `cairnid.evidence_manifest`, `cairnid.evidence_status`, `cairnid.evidence_check`, constrained by an allowlisted evidence root. | Windows CI `cargo test`/clippy, Linux/Windows distribution smoke, and local MCP `2025-11-25` stdio validation. | `cairnid-mcp` Linux x86_64 and Windows x86_64 archives after a published GitHub Release; until then use Cargo from source. | MCP Windows behavior gate, MCP `2025-11-25` stdio smoke, release-assets verification for the published archive. | Remote/network MCP hosting, write-capable evidence tools, unconstrained filesystem access, raw artifact/log/secret exposure. |
| cairnid CLI | Operator release-evidence CLI; first public install path pending. | `cairnid evidence plan`, `manifest`, `init`, `status`, and `check`; CLI archives include generated completions and roff manpages for `cairnid` and its subcommands. | Windows CI `cargo test -p cairnid --locked`, Linux/Windows distribution smokes, Rust stable 1.96+. | `cairnid` Linux x86_64 and Windows x86_64 archives after a published GitHub Release; until then use Cargo from source. | CLI Windows lifecycle proof, release-assets verification, final `cairnid evidence check`. | Package-manager distribution, unattended install scripts, production support before a published release. |
| API runtime | Source/container-build target for RC evidence; no production support window yet. | Rust stable 1.96+ workspace, Axum API, OIDC/OAuth, SCIM, admin/session, operations commands. | Ubuntu CI with native dependencies; Windows GNU toolchain for local Rust verification where MSVC is unavailable; root Dockerfile Debian runtime smoke. | Reviewed source checkout or locally built API image; no public API binary or container image. | Rust quality gates, operations preflight, deployed HTTPS smokes, restore/key/audit/email evidence. | Published API server binary, public container image, registry digest, non-HTTPS production issuer posture, production service-level agreement. |
| Web runtime | SvelteKit web UI tested with Bun tooling and Bun-run adapter-node output. | Bun 1.3.14 package manager/scripts, Vite/SvelteKit/Vitest/Playwright CLI execution, and Docker runtime. | CI web job with Bun 1.3.14; `apps/web/Dockerfile` uses `oven/bun:1.3.14` build/runtime images. | Reviewed source checkout or locally built web image; no public site/runtime artifact. | `bun run check`, `bun run test`, `bun run build`, `bun run test:e2e`, web image smoke. | Non-Bun JavaScript tooling/runtime paths, published web image, static/site runtime distribution. |
| Database | Postgres-backed only. | Postgres 17 migrations and runtime schema. | `postgres:17-alpine` in CI service and local Compose. | Operator-provided Postgres; no managed database package. | Postgres 17 migration tests, operations preflight, restore drill. | MySQL, SQLite, untested Postgres major versions, production database support without restore evidence. |
| Local Compose/containers | Local Compose and CI image smoke only. | `infra/docker-compose.yml` starts Postgres 17, API, and web; Dockerfiles build API and web images. | CI validates Compose config, builds both images, smokes API key generation, Bun version, and web `/healthz`. | Source checkout Compose/Dockerfiles; operators build locally. | Containers gate, deployment smoke, preflight, release evidence. | Published images, registry policy/digests, Helm/Kubernetes package, production orchestration support; Kubernetes is custom until a package exists. |
| Public release artifacts | Pending first published GitHub Release. | Tag-driven release builds `cairnid` and `cairnid-mcp` archives for Linux x86_64 and Windows x86_64, plus CycloneDX SBOMs, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, `release-manifest.json`, and GitHub artifact attestations. Manual workflow dispatch can rehearse the same assembly path without publishing. | `.github/workflows/release.yml` requires a valid tag, matching Cargo package versions for `cairnid` and `cairnid-mcp`, source commit reachable from `origin/main`, successful CI for the tagged commit, release-mode build, direct and archive-extracted binary version smokes, package validation, local `cairnid release-assets verify` inspection using the produced Linux CLI archive, and attestations. Workflow-local verifier output is expected to remain non-passing until a public release URL exists. Manual rehearsal uses a candidate tag and expects the local verifier to fail only on publish-only confirmations, the absent public release URL, and any absent real tag ref. | Draft-reviewed GitHub Release after maintainers publish it. | `release-assets-verification.json` proving archives, SBOMs, checksums, manifest, published GitHub Release URL, GitHub release immutability enabled before publication, provenance, and SBOM attestations. Manual rehearsal and workflow-run output are not release evidence. | crates.io, Homebrew, MSI, macOS/notarized binaries, Authenticode-signed Windows binaries, container images, site/runtime artifacts, install scripts. |
| Security/support window | No supported production releases yet. | Security fixes target `main` until versioned releases exist; private vulnerability reporting is in scope. | Best-effort triage targets in `SECURITY.md`; no contractual service-level agreement. | `SECURITY.md` and `SUPPORT.md`; no LTS branch or support package. | Release gates closed, published version, security advisory/release-note process when a public release exists. | LTS, backports, production support window, paid/contractual service-level agreement. |
| Future/out-of-scope product features | Not part of first-RC support. | Roadmap-only areas after the hardened core. | No release evidence for first RC. | None. | Future roadmap/release-gate updates before any support claim. | SAML, LDAP/Active Directory integration, upstream identity brokering, reverse-proxy auth mode, device trust/shared signals, Helm/Kubernetes package, certified directory templates. |

## Evidence Workflow

Until the first tagged RC is published, run the current CLI from a local checkout with `cargo run -p cairnid --locked -- <args>` or build it locally with `cargo build -p cairnid --locked` and run the resulting binary from `target`.

```powershell
cargo run -p cairnid --locked -- evidence plan
cargo run -p cairnid --locked -- evidence init <evidence-dir>
cargo run -p cairnid --locked -- evidence status --evidence-dir <evidence-dir>
cargo run -p cairnid --locked -- evidence check --evidence-dir <evidence-dir>
```

`cairnid evidence plan` confirms that required environment variable names are present without printing values. Its root `local_capture_ready` field distinguishes local/generated capture readiness from manual or provider-backed evidence still listed in `pending_manual_evidence` and `pending_external_evidence`. `cairnid evidence init` creates the guarded evidence directory. `cairnid evidence status` shows missing or failed artifacts while evidence is being collected. `cairnid evidence check` is the final local release gate.

The CLI evidence JSON reports carry root `schema_version="cairnid.evidence.v1"` for machine-readable contract stability. Additive fields can appear under the same version, but removing or renaming fields, changing field meanings, changing stable status values, weakening redaction expectations, or changing count/failure semantics requires a new schema version. `status` and `check` include stable `failure_codes` alongside sanitized failure text; `status.next_actions[]` and `check.artifacts[]` include per-artifact `failure_codes` when evidence validation reaches an artifact. Artifact entries in plan, manifest, status/check, next-action, and generated README output include `release_gate` ownership labels so operators can map each artifact back to this gate table.

Stable `cairnid evidence` exit codes:

- `0`: success.
- `1`: unexpected internal error.
- `2`: clap usage or parse error before runtime execution.
- `3`: the command printed JSON, but the release evidence set or capture environment is incomplete.
- `4`: operator input, path, or scaffold error, such as an evidence path that is not a directory or an existing scaffold without `--force`.

Do not commit release evidence directories. They can include operational context and must stay in controlled storage.

## CLI and MCP Release Assets

Pushing a tag that matches `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` or `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-rc.N` starts `.github/workflows/release.yml`. The workflow validates the tag with an exact regex, then runs `cargo metadata --locked --no-deps --format-version 1` and requires the `cairnid` and `cairnid-mcp` package versions to exactly equal the tag version without the leading `v`. For example, a `v0.1.0-rc.1` tag requires both packages to report version `0.1.0-rc.1`; version `0.1.0` is rejected before builds start. The workflow also rejects tags that are not reachable from `origin/main` and requires a successful completed `CI` run for the exact tagged commit before release artifacts are built. It then builds release-mode `cairnid` and `cairnid-mcp` binaries for:

- `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

For each tag, the workflow creates a draft GitHub Release containing:

- Versioned archives for each binary and target. The workflow writes archives with sorted file members, normalized member timestamps, fixed file modes, and no Linux tar owner identity, then checks that both directly built binaries and the archive-extracted binaries report the exact release version through `--version`. Each `cairnid` CLI archive also contains generated Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell, and Elvish completions under `completions/`, plus roff manpages for `cairnid` and its subcommands under `man/man1/`; `cairnid-mcp` archives do not contain these CLI-only files.
- CycloneDX JSON SBOMs generated with `cargo-cyclonedx`.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- `release-manifest.json` with source commit, workflow run, target, archive, SBOM, CLI archive auxiliary-file paths, and SHA-256 metadata.
- GitHub artifact attestations created with `actions/attest@v4`, GitHub Actions OIDC, and Sigstore, without long-lived signing keys.

Maintainers must review and publish the draft before the assets are public. RC tags are marked as prereleases and are not marked latest. No public crates.io packages, Homebrew formulae, MSI installers, macOS notarized binaries, signed Windows binaries, container images, install scripts, or site/runtime release artifacts exist yet.

Before draft release creation, the release workflow extracts the produced Linux `cairnid` archive and runs `cairnid release-assets verify` against the assembled local `dist` directory using the workflow run URL. That workflow-local receipt is expected to exit non-zero only because the public GitHub Release URL is not available yet; the workflow still checks that every archive and SBOM was inspected and that attestation confirmations were recorded. It stays in runner temp storage and gates release creation, but it is not the published-release evidence receipt that maintainers capture after downloading public assets and verifying attestations. Workflow-run receipts do not claim that GitHub release immutability was enabled before publication.

Maintainers can run a non-publishing release rehearsal before creating a tag:

```powershell
gh workflow run release.yml --repo cairnid/cairnid --ref main -f candidate_tag=v0.1.0-rc.1
```

The rehearsal path validates the candidate tag format, checks package versions with `cargo metadata --locked --no-deps --format-version 1`, builds release-mode `cairnid` and `cairnid-mcp` for Linux x86_64 and Windows x86_64, runs the direct and archive-extracted CLI/MCP version and smoke checks, packages archives, generates SBOMs, writes `release-manifest.json` and `SHA256SUMS.txt`, validates archive contents and checksums, and runs local `cairnid release-assets verify` from the produced Linux CLI archive. It deliberately does not create a tag, check for a successful CI run on the candidate tag commit, create a GitHub Release, generate artifact attestations, or upload assets to a GitHub Release. The local verifier is expected to fail only because the public GitHub Release URL and publish-only attestation confirmations are absent and, when dispatched from a branch, the manifest source ref is not a real tag ref.

CI distribution smoke artifacts are different. The regular CI workflow uploads short-lived Actions artifacts named `*-ci-rehearsal-*` to prove release-mode binaries can build and smoke-test before a tag exists. Manual release rehearsal uploads short-lived Actions artifacts named `release-rehearsal-assets-*` for maintainer inspection. These artifacts are not public release assets, are not attached to a GitHub Release, and are not the install path for users.

Container checks are also different from public release assets. CI validates Compose configuration, builds the API and web images, and runs image-level smoke checks, but no workflow currently pushes images to a registry or records public container digests. Container publication requires a separate registry policy and workflow before it can be documented as a release artifact.

### User verification after a release is published

These are local user verification commands. They do not create release evidence by themselves. `v0.1.0-rc.1` is a future example tag; replace it with an actual published GitHub Release tag after maintainers publish the release.

```powershell

The default `gh attestation verify` command checks the SLSA provenance predicate. The command with `--predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom` checks the SBOM attestation for each archive. Run the same pattern for every published target that the user installs or records in evidence.

For release evidence, do not paste command output into the receipt. After the external attestation checks pass, generate the normalized, token-free receipt from the downloaded asset directory:

```powershell

```

The command reads local `SHA256SUMS.txt`, `release-manifest.json`, four archives, and four SBOMs; recomputes SHA-256; confirms the manifest source and non-distribution flags; validates SBOM `bomFormat="CycloneDX"`; verifies archive member structure for binaries, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, CLI completions and nested manpages; rejects unexpected archive members; verifies normalized archive timestamps, file modes, and Linux tar owner metadata; and emits the receipt fields required by `release-assets-verification.json`, including root `schema_version="cairnid.release_assets_verification.v1"`. It does not download assets, call `gh`, verify remote attestations, query GitHub release settings, or write files. The two attestation flags are explicit operator confirmations that the preceding `gh attestation verify` commands succeeded. The `--github-release-immutability-enabled-before-publish` flag is an operator confirmation that GitHub release immutability was enabled before the release was published. GitHub immutable releases lock release assets and the associated Git tag after publication, and enabling immutability applies only to future releases, so enabling it after publication is not acceptable final evidence for that release. Verification failures after the release directory can be inspected exit 3 and still emit structured stdout JSON with `status="failed"` and non-empty `failures`; do not save failed output as release evidence. The evidence checker accepts `release-assets-verification.json` only when `schema_version="cairnid.release_assets_verification.v1"`, `status="ok"`, `failures` is empty, the receipt includes the published GitHub Release URL, and `github_release_immutability_enabled_before_publish` is `true`. Do not use a workflow `--run-url` receipt as release evidence; run-URL receipts are workflow-local validation output and remain non-passing for the public release evidence contract. Do not include GitHub tokens, request headers, cookies, raw attestation payloads, debug logs, or copied stdout/stderr.

## Current Blockers

- No first public RC tag has been pushed and published.
- No `release-assets-verification.json` can be captured until a first public RC GitHub Release exists and its assets are verified.
- No current `dependency-policy-check.json` release receipt has been captured for a release-evidence directory.
- No current `operations-preflight.json` has been captured from the target production-like deployment.
- No current static OpenID artifacts, `openid-static-registration.json` and `cairn-oidcc-static.json`, have been captured from the target issuer/static clients.
- No container image publishing workflow or registry policy exists; CI container checks are smoke evidence only.
- No published OpenID Foundation conformance result.
- No deployed HTTPS metadata/JWKS smoke receipt.
- No deployed browser-origin or security-header smoke receipt.
- No command-provider `email-provider-smoke.json` or `lifecycle-email-smoke.json` receipt.
- No production-like restore, signing-key rotation, KEK rotation, break-glass, audit export, or audit purge drill receipt.
- No SCIM connector profile artifacts, built-in `scim-smoke.json`, or external Okta and Entra SCIM connector summaries.
- Repository or organization release immutability must be enabled before publishing the first public RC so the final release-assets receipt can confirm release assets and the associated tag are locked after publication.
